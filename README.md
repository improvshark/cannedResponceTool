| [!Section][/!Section][Group:!Section][/Group:!Section] | The ! at the beginning of a Section name will make the section not display when it normally would. If its turned off it will show. Basically the opposite of what the switch says. | [!Strike:Third Strike]As the account is suspended, you will not be able to log in via cPanel or FTP at this time. In order to have the suspension lifted on your account, please reply and confirm that action will be taken to reduce load on the shared server as soon as possible. [/!Strike:Third Strike] So for more explanation this will only show if its marked as first or second strike and not when its a third strike. |
